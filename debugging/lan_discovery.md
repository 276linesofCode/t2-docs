# Debugging LAN Discovery

## Introduction to MDNS

The Tessel 2 CLI is able to detect Tessel 2s on the same wireless network as your host computer using a protocol called [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS). If you run `t2 list` and don't see your Tessel labeled LAN like the example below, then either the Tessel is not advertising properly, your wifi network infrastructure blocks mDNS traffic, or your computer is not picking it up properly.

```
âžœ  t2 list
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
  Frank LAN
```

## An issue with detection
First, let's check if your computer is able to detect the Tessel at all (to determine if it's an issue with the CLI or with the Tessel). We'll use a utility that we absolutely know works.

*I only have an example for OSX - if you know how to do mDNS discovery on Windows or Linux, please add to this file and submit a PR!*
### OSX
```
dns-sd -B _tessel._tcp .
```
This tells the `dns-sd` (DNS Service Discovery) tool to start searching for any devices advertising as a `_tessel._tcp` device. If your device doesn't show up in the results, then it is an issue with detection, then your computer isn't detecting it up properly.

There is also issue a peculiar but uncommon issue where OSX just stops picking up the advertisements for some reason. The cause is unknown thus far but you can fix it with:
```
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```
This command basically clears the cache of mDNS devices so the next time you run the `dns-sd` utility or `t2 list`, Tessel will show up (if this was the root cause).

## An issue with network configuration
There could also be an issue with the network you're computer is using where it blocks mDNS traffic. We've seen the latter case numerous times on company wifi networks. If it is a network configuration issue - you'll have solve that social engineering problem on your own.

## An issue with advertisement
To determine if it's an issue with Tessel not advertising properly, you'll need to get [root access](https://github.com/tessel/onboarding/blob/master/SSH-AND-DTERM.md) to your Tessel. Then run `ps` to check if the mDNS service is actually running on Tessel:
```
 1259 root       904 S    dns-sd -R Frank _tessel._tcp local 22
```
If you don't see this service running (note that the name of your Tessel will be different), you can restart it with:
```
/etc/init.d/tessel-mdns restart
```
Once it's restarted, check if it's running with the `dns-sd` utility on your host machine or `t2 list`.
