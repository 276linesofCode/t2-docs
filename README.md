Developer guide to Tessel 2 Docs Gitbook
============

# Requirements
The docs are build using a command line tool called [GitBook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook), which requires:

* [Node Version 4 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM Version 2 or higher](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

# Running locally

* `git clone https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs.git`
* `cd t2-docs`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

# Changing the contents

SUMMARY.md is autogenerated using the gitbook-summary tool, using instructions from `book.json`. The command to regenerate is `npm run build`, which is automatically run during the `npm start` command.
