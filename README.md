This is a Gitbook-formatted guide. You may read the processed document at [https://www.gitbook.com/book/tessel/t2-docs/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/tessel/t2-docs/details). PRs to this repository are automatically published online.

## Developing the Gitbook

### Requirements
The docs are built using a command line tool called [GitBook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook), which requires:

* [Node Version 4 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM Version 2 or higher](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

### Running Gitbook locally

* Clone this repo: `https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs.git` ([Learn more here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/))
* Moving into the docs directory: `cd t2-docs`
* Install the project dependecies: `npm install`
* Start the documentation generation: `npm start`

### Changing the contents

SUMMARY.md is autogenerated using the gitbook-summary tool, using instructions from `book.json`. The command to regenerate is `npm run build`, which is automatically run during the `npm start` command.
